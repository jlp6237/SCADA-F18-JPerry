**Analysis/Methodologies**  
To begin this assignment I researched how to use the software provided to create a working silo. The videos I found did not provide me with a full understanding of how to logically make the actions of the rungs complete the three different configurations of A, B and C. Configuration A required the box to continually get to the prox sensor and fill to the level sensor by releasing the solenoid valve and then continue off the conveyor and have a new box appear and do the same without flooding from the solenoid valve. Configuration B would do the same thing as A except it would stop after being filled and needed the start button to be pushed in order to continue off the conveyor belt. Configuration C did not fill any of the boxes instead the boxes would just continue off the conveyor belt and new empty box would appear and do the same. 

**Collaboration statement**  
For this assignment I worked on understanding the software with Alyxandra Van Stockum and Nicholas Guerra.    
I researched and used the following videos for help with solutions to the logic of the software:
