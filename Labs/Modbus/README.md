**Analysis/Methodologies**  
For the modbus labs I followed the specified direction worksheets. These worksheets took me step by step to create a master and a slave where the master could read and write to the slave's system. I could also see wireshark capturing all of the actions on the slaves system. Next, I used Nmap to find which IP address was the slaves on port 502. Then, I used Metasploit to write to the slaves system. Lastly, I followed the directions to create a python script that should which IP addresses would respond to my system and which gave no response. 

**Collaboration statement**  
For this assignment I worked with Alyxandra Van Stockum and Nicholas Guerra on a few parts of the lab to ensure that everything was completed correctly.
